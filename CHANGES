{{ $NEXT }}

    - Fixed compatibility with Mojolicious 9.11. Thanks @eserte for
      reporting this issue! [Github #12]

0.014     2021-03-04 09:38:26-06:00 America/Chicago

    [BREAKING]

    - The `path` field is now called `slug`. You must change your route
      placeholders.

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed compatibility with Mojolicious 9. Mojolicious 9 makes
      reserved stash values like `path` illegal to put as route
      placeholder names.


0.013     2020-08-04 21:07:41-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed compatibility with Yancy v1.057 and later: These versions
      removed the `id` stash field and replaced it with a field named
      after the ID of the schema (so, in this case, `path`). Thanks
      @tehmoth for reporting this issue! [Github #22]
    - Fixed array fields failing validation if not explicitly an array.
      This prevents needing to make a one-element array when there's
      only one element.

0.012     2019-11-24 14:46:18-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added an `?encoding=...` override to allow specifying an encoding
      when the auto-detection fails. This feature is used to fix a test
      failure from trying to decode UTF-8 as though it were whatever
      random locale we're currently running in. Thanks @eserte for the
      report! [Github #10]

0.011     2019-11-23 22:38:29-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed a missing test dependency. Thanks @manwar! [Github #9]
    - Fixed encoding/decoding files into the current locale. This is
      necessary because users are intended to edit these files outside
      of Yancy (with their own editors). Thanks @dagmatritsa for
      reporting this issue! [Github preaction/Yancy#82]

0.010     2019-10-12 18:08:37-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added an example application and some getting started
      documentation [Github #8]

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed the code example in the SYNOPSIS. Thanks @Ferki for
      reporting this! [Github #8]

0.009     2019-10-11 22:46:20-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed files without frontmatter being saved incorrectly. Thanks
      @wbazant! [Github #6]

0.008     2019-09-24 20:42:09-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed changing the "path" field in the item. Previously it would
      do nothing. Now it correctly moves the file to the new path.
      Thanks @wbazant! [Github #5]
    - Fixed issue where YAML.pm would save JSON::PP booleans as a Perl
      object and not the YAML 'false'. Thanks @wbazant! [Github #4]

0.007     2019-09-13 23:09:59-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed paths ending in an extension not working. Thanks @wbazant!
      [Github #3]

0.006     2019-09-04 21:08:57-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Correctly decode Markdown files as UTF-8 so that high-byte
      characters render properly on the webapp. Thanks @wbazant!
      [Github #2]

0.005     2019-08-20 20:41:57-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed relative links on index files. Browsers require a trailing
      slash to correctly resolve relative links, so this backend no
      longer allows directories without a trailing slash.

0.004     2019-07-06 18:55:13-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added better support for search and ordering in the `list`
      function. This is provided directly by Yancy::Util's `match` and
      `order_by` functions, so any improvements to those will improve
      this.

0.003     2019-04-25 09:50:29+01:00 Europe/London

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed a missing prereq reported by CPANTS. Thanks @manwar!
      [Github #1]

0.002     2019-04-25 09:44:47+01:00 Europe/London

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed `set()` not working with Yancy::Command::backend::copy. The
      `set()` method now can create new files with the given ID, and
      should probably be preferred to `create()` (which does not require
      an ID, but uses the `path` attribute).

0.001     2019-04-19 17:05:22-05:00 America/Chicago

    - Initial release
    - Basic support for Markdown pages
